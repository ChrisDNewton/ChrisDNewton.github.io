**Assessment 2 - Survey Data Analysis**

The intention of this software was to develop some code that may be relevant and useful to my PhD research, i.e. looking at social and psychological influences on peopleâ€™s dietary choices. As I will mostly be working with survey data, it made sense to use this assessment as an opportunity to gain familiarity with the Pandas software library for the purpose of data exploration and statistical analysis. I chose the British Social Attitudes survey from 2014 (available [here](https://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/catalogue/?sn=7809)) as a data source for this project as it is freely available and features a great deal of demographic information as well as a range of questions about meat-eating behaviour and attitudes among the British public. Linear and logistic regression were chosen as appropriate statistical techniques for examining relationships between variables.
