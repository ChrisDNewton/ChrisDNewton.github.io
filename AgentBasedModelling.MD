This is currently a placeholder page. 

It will include some information about ABM, as well as details of the project, images and snippets of code.

It will include a link to the code in GitHub as well.

Agent based models (ABM) have been increasingly applied in computational social sciences since the 1970s (Conte and Paolucci, 2014).
