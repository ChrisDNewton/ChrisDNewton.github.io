For the module *Programming for Social Science: Core Skills* I have been learning some [agent-based modelling](https://chrisdnewton.github.io/AgentBasedModelling), and am developing some code for carrying out a Random Forest classification of survey data. More information on these projects will appear as they develop over the next few weeks.
