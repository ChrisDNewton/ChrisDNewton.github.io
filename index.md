**Bio**

Prior to commencing the PhD program I studied MSc Geographical Information Science at the University of Manchester, where my dissertation focussed on applying machine learning techniques to produce wildlife habitat maps from Sentinel-2A satellite imagery. Before this I studied Geography and Environmental Management at the University of the West of England and went on to work as technical admin support for the Environment Agencyâ€™s Air Quality Modelling and Assessment Unit and as a forestry administrator for the Soil Association.
